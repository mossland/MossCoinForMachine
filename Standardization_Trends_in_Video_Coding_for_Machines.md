# Standardization Trends in Video Coding for Machines

This document delves into the research on standardization trends in video coding specifically designed for machines. It focuses on the efficient compression of video data to meet the requirements of machine vision, discussing the progress and technical aspects of standardization efforts, particularly under the MPEG VCM initiative.

## Introduction

- The exponential increase in video data generated by IoT, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, etc.
- The growing demand for services that can recognize and analyze video data objects and events.
- Existing video codecs are designed considering the human visual system, which may not efficiently handle information needed for machine tasks.
- The need for new video coding technologies that maintain machine task performance while efficiently compressing video data.

## MPEG VCM Standardization Trends

- MPEG VCM represents efforts to develop video compression standards focusing on machine vision.
- It aims to maximize video compression rates while maintaining the performance of machine vision tasks.
- The VCM pipeline can include video coding for both humans and machines, meeting the requirements for multi-task performance and real-time processing.

## VCM Proposed Technology Performance Evaluation

- Performance evaluation of VCM considers both vision task performance and compression efficiency.
- The definition of anchors and performance evaluation methods is crucial for assessing video compression technologies in VCM.
- Various datasets and performance metrics are used to measure the efficiency of video compression technologies and their task performance.

## Future Issues

- Developing a compression framework for hybrid vision services and multi-task performance is a significant challenge.
- Future standardization efforts will focus on the efficiency and scalability of video coding methods for both human and machine vision.
